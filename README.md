[Jumpstart to 2D Game Development: Godot 4.4+ for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/jumpstart-to-2d-game-development-godot-4-for-beginners/?couponCode=ST22MT240325G3) Master the Godot 4 Engine, Build Engaging 2D Games, Learn GDScript and Ignite Your Game Development Journey! This repository showcases the games I have made with Godot as part of this course.

## Curriculum
By the end of this course, I will have built a diverse portfolio of 2D game projects, showcasing my abilites with Godot 4 and my ability to create captivating gameplay experiences.

## What I have learned thorughout this course

- Master Godot 4: scene creation, input handling, collision detection, and more in the powerful Godot 4 game engine.
- Created Diverse Games: Develop Flappy Bird, Angry Birds, memory games, platformers, puzzles, space shooters, and maze escapes.
- Acquire Game Dev Skills: Gain level design, animation, enemy AI, power-ups, UI design, and apply design patterns like singletons and event buses.
- Explore Mechanics & Patterns: Understand parallax scrolling, physics-based gameplay, pathfinding AI, state machines, and dynamic level loading.

## Commit types
The commit type can include the following:
- **build**: changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **chore**: changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies)
- **ci**: continuous integration related
- **docs**: updates to documentation such as a the README or other markdown files
- **feat**: a new feature is introduced with the changes
- **fix**: a bug fix has occurred
- **perf**: performance improvements
- **refactor**: refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **revert**: reverts a previous commit
- **style**: changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semicolons, and so on.
- **test**: including new or correcting previous tests
